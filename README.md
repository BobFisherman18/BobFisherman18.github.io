## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Border-Box
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
  section {
    margin: 0px;
  }
  img {
    padding: 0px;
    border-radius: 0%;
  }
}
/* This code below sets a div element centered */
width: 90%;
margin-left: auto;
margin-right: auto;
```

### Continued development

What I need to focus on is mobile and desktop development. I also need to
start learning Flexbos as it is a good tool when developing websites.
In addition, I need to focus on improving my CSS skills. This project took me
three days to complete. I had no trouble in HTML coding, but CSS took me two days to at least try to replicate the design file.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This what helped me learn HTML and CSS.
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez) - This Youtuber also helped me learn HTML and CSS. In addition, I watched a lot of Youtube videos about HTML and CSS. Youtube is your best friend in learning web development!
